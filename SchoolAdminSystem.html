            <h1>What I learnt</h1>
            I learnt a lot about C++ from this project. I had never worked with pointers and references, and it was
            something I found intuitive and fun. Because I had a background in a similar language I could pick up C++
            rather quickly, and could focus on more advanced features of the language.

            <h1>Explanation</h1>
            I wanted a system to handle saving & loading neatly, so I spent some time over-engineering all of it.
            The result is a set of functions that can save any type of object, with just two lines of code.
            The saving is the easy part, turning the binaries back into objects was slightly harder, and it's done by
            separating whether the caller wants usernames, passwords or every object related to one of the groups,
            namely Students, Parents, Teachers, Admins or Lectures.

            <h1>Difficulties</h1>
            The largest difficulty I faced was using pointers and references correctly, specifically remembering to
            free up memory after using it.
