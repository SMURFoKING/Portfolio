            If you know Python, you know it's not meant for web-applications. Despite that, this was our assignment.<br>

            <h1>What I learnt</h1>
            I learnt mainly about Python and the game-making framework Pygame. While I did originally want to try to
            develop this with a purely functional programming style, I realized foregoing objects in a game
            would be counter-productive, if not plain stupid.

            <h1>Explanation</h1>
            We were meant to develop an application with python, and have it run on a web-browser. Me and Cory chose a game
            as our application. Because of the limited resources we could use on a web-browser we decided a simple game
            would be smart. Cory came up with the idea of a retro racing game. I did most of the code, while Cory found or
            created assets we could use.

            <h1>Difficulties</h1>
            The main difficulty getting a game to work on a website, was the language we used to develop the game.
            My friend Cory was lucky and found a packager that we could use to compile Python & Pygame into workable HTML.
            This packager is called PygBag. Beyond this I had very few difficulties in development, since
            I've done this sort of game many times it was mostly routine.
