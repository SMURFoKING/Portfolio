        <h3>I love programming. It's my passion.<br></h3>
    <div id="aboutMe">
        <span>
            Since I discovered programming through game development back when I was
            14 years old, I've continually tried to improve my coding skills.
            I enjoy reading, so I've read programming books that have taught me core principles and good practices.
            I've done my best to continually challenge myself, with different ways of programming and through learning
            different languages. I now know 3 languages well, namely <b>C++</b>, <b>Python</b> & <b>C#</b>.
            <br><br>
            One of the biggest things I've learnt, is how important it is to keep code short and concise, with good
            naming conventions.
            I always keep my functions as short as possible, where they only do one thing each, with a good
            name that encapsulates exactly everything it does. Then whenever problems inevitably appear, I can easily track down
            from where, why such a thing is happening and quickly patch it.<br><br>
