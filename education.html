                        I studied Game Development for 3 years at LBS, where I learnt C#, 3D modelling, texture creation,
                        and other Game Dev related things. <br>Here are some examples:<br>

                        C++ has become the language I am the most confident and comfortable in after we studied it for our
                        first year at Yoobee.<br> Because of my experience with Unity (A very buggy Game Dev application),
                        I have learnt robust debugging methods, as well as good problem-solving abilities.<br>
                        <br>
                        I'm showing the code below to hopefully showcase that I understand pointers & references.<br>
                        It's a set of functions to save & load lists of objects.<br>
                        The reason I use template functions is that it allows me to easily add additional support
                        for other object types. <br>

                        We were also taught UI/UX design, HTML & CSS, which we then used to redesign and then develop
                        a website. <br>

                        In our second year we took a datascience class and learnt the basics of how to create AI
                        algorithms to help us produce some predictions on a dataset.
