            <h1>Explanation</h1>
            At the beginning of our education at Yoobee, I was tasked with finding a website that I could redesign.<br>
            <a href="https://www.satya.co.nz/"> This</a> is the one I chose. I used Adobe XD for creating wireframes & style guides.<br>

            I created user-personas, surveys and took user feedback on my sketches.

            <h1>What I learnt</h1>
            I learnt a LOT from this project. It was the first time I worked with HTML & CSS,
            which was very different from any other language I'd used. I learnt about designing user interfaces,
            how to create a good user experience and the general outline of how a website is designed and how to
            realize this with code. <br><br>
        </span>
        <span class="text">
            <h1>Difficulties</h1>
            While I found the designing process fun and intuitive, actually transferring that into a website was very
            difficult. I knew how I wanted things to look, but realizing this with HTML & CSS only was difficult.
            <br><br>
            The next time I create a website I hope I'll be able to use frameworks that help me with this.
